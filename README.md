YOUR LIFE IS CURRENCY

# idea 4
## SHREK SCENE WHERE THEY SELL FAIRYTALE CREATURES

* you capture fairytale creatures and you put them to work
* you play as the guard captain and try to swindle poor peasants out of their critters
* you play as a peasant and you have to make as much money as possible out of your fairy tale creatures
* ALTERNATE ONIONVERSE you are shrek armed with a net to capture fairy tale creatures, attempting to capture enough fairy tale creatures and sell them into lives of harsh servitude in order to buy your swamp back
    * money can be spent on powerups (this delays victory)
    * fairy tale critters fight back (they can kill you, and you lose)
    * donkey is the final boss

## Game Play - start to finish

* shrek must capture fairy tale creatures
    * (Optional) avoid villains of some sort on the way back (similar to terraria)
    * creatures get stronger the more that you capture
    * creatures frenzy if you capture too many of their type
    * damage creatures to weaken them for netting (similar to pokemon)
    * (Optional) we can add a mechanic where the net gets damaged if you attempt to net strong creatures too many times and needs repair ($$$)
* shrek must return to the guard captain to sell his captured creatures
* next to the guard captain is a booth where you can buy powerups
    * Speed Power-up (this one times out)
    * Stealth Power-up (this one times out, turns aggro on sight to passive aggro)
    * Stronger net (nice to have, more durability to the net)
    * Swamp Bubble Power-up (like Sonic 3's bubble, one free hit & *1.5 jump height)
    * Fairy Dust Power-up (Slow fall speed )

*End goal
